Il Duomo di Firenze, as it is ordinarily called, was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style to the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De Fabris.\nThe cathedral complex, located in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile. The three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting the region of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches, and until development of new structural materials in the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed.\nThe cathedral is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence, whose archbishop is currently Giuseppe Betori.]]></data>\n            </element>\n        </elementSet>\n        <elementSet name=\"Item Type Metadata\">\n            <element name=\"Physical Dimensions\">\n                <data>Height: 114.5 m</data>\n            </element>\n        </elementSet>\n        <extra>\n            <data name=\"geolocation[latitude]\">43.773145</data>\n            <data name=\"geolocation[longitude]\">11.2559602</data>\n            <data name=\"geolocation[zoom_level]\">18</data>\n            <data name=\"geolocation[map_type]\"/>\n            <data name=\"geolocation[address]\"/>\n            <data name=\"tag\">Church</data>\n            <data name=\"tag\">Quattrocento</data>\n        </extra>\n        <record file=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/The_Cathedral_panoramic_view_from_Vecchio_Palace_Florence_Italy.jpg/1280px-The_Cathedral_panoramic_view_from_Vecchio_Palace_Florence_Italy.jpg\">\n            <elementSet name=\"Dublin Core\">\n                <element name=\"Title\">\n                    <data>The Cathedral panoramic view from Vecchio Palace, Florence, Italy</data>\n                </element>\n            </elementSet>\n        </record>\n    </record>","format_xml":"doc"},"specific":{"collection":"Architectural Heritage","featured":"1","tags":["Church","Quattrocento"],"item_type_name":"Still Image"},"metadata":{"Dublin Core":{"Title":["Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore","English: Florence Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore"],"Creator":["Arnolfo di Cambio"],"Date":["1436"],"Description":["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore (English, \"Basilica of Saint Mary of the Flower\") is the main church of Florence, Italy.
